/// A fifth recognition engine, alongside `WhisperEngine`, `WhisperCppEngine`,
/// and `ParakeetEngine`: currently four selectable models, all run via
/// k2-fsa's sherpa-onnx C API (`Vendor/sherpa-onnx.xcframework`, vendored
/// from the official `sherpa-onnx` PyPI wheel — see NOTICE.md). SenseVoice
/// (Alibaba's Apache-2.0 multilingual model) was screened first as a
/// benchmark-only candidate (`scripts/benchmark_engines.py`,
/// `scripts/_sherpa_onnx_worker.py`) — tied the other four engines at 3.2%
/// WER on a saturated synthetic test set but ran roughly 6x faster,
/// CPU-only with no Neural Engine acceleration at all. Canary (NVIDIA's
/// 180M "flash" model, genuinely multilingual: en/es/de/fr) was added
/// alongside it once sherpa-onnx itself had cleared the "does this actually
/// work as a real Swift engine" bar SenseVoice's screening was for.
///
/// FunASR Nano and Qwen3-ASR are a different shape from every other model
/// here: instead of a direct CTC/transducer decode, both feed an encoder
/// into a small LLM decoder (Qwen3-0.6B) that generates the transcript
/// token-by-token, the same kind of generative decode the on-device rewrite
/// model already does for Styles/Transforms — fully local, no network
/// call, just a different (heavier) architecture than SenseVoice/Canary's
/// single-pass decode. Genuinely large next to everything else here
/// (~1 GB and ~980 MB respectively, vs. 70–285 MB for the others) and
/// slower to load (~1.5–2s), but both cleared the bar that actually
/// matters — the user's own real dictation, not just the synthetic-audio
/// taste test every model gets first (see the class-level lesson on
/// Zipformer/Moonshine below, which passed that same synthetic test and
/// then failed on real speech). Confirmed accurate, same standing as
/// SenseVoice/Canary now.
///
/// **Two other families — Zipformer and Moonshine — were built, tried, and
/// pulled from `availableModels`.** Real dictation testing (not just the
/// synthetic `say`-generated audio every model was screened on) found both
/// made noticeably more transcription errors than SenseVoice/Canary, which
/// were accurate throughout — Zipformer on a whole sentence, Moonshine
/// (even after upgrading "tiny" → "base") on a single longer word
/// ("transcribes" → "trans citesmy", a boundary/segmentation miss). Neither
/// had a further lever to pull once found: Zipformer's "medium" and "large"
/// LibriHeavy punct-case checkpoints are byte-identical in encoder size
/// (259.8 MB fp32, both — different training runs of the same capacity,
/// not bigger models), and Moonshine "base" is Useful Sensors' own largest
/// size — there's no bigger Moonshine checkpoint to try. Both are pulled
/// from `availableModels` the same way `ParakeetEngine` hides its "flash"
/// model — the working code paths (`family`, `directoryName`,
/// `createRecognizer`, `download`) are untouched and still reachable via
/// `--engine sherpa --sherpa-model zipformer-en` / `moonshine-base-en` on
/// the CLI, in case better checkpoints show up later; they're just not
/// offered as choices.
///
/// A fifth family, Zipformer CTC (would've been an even-faster CTC variant
/// of the Zipformer architecture), was evaluated and never added at all:
/// its only available English checkpoint has the identical flat-uppercase,
/// no-punctuation problem the plain Zipformer transducer checkpoint had —
/// confirmed against the Python reference bindings — and unlike the
/// transducer, no properly-cased alternative checkpoint exists in the
/// sherpa-onnx model zoo to swap in.
///
/// Unlike WhisperKit/whisper.cpp/Parakeet, sherpa-onnx runs entirely on CPU
/// via ONNX Runtime — there's no CoreML/ANE backend for it, so its speed
/// advantage over the ANE-accelerated engines is real architecture, not a
/// measurement artifact, even though the benchmark's WER tie isn't yet a
/// meaningful accuracy signal (see the memory this was screened under).
///
/// The huge, deeply-nested `SherpaOnnxOfflineRecognizerConfig` C struct
/// (~20 alternate model-family sub-configs) is deliberately never touched
/// from Swift directly — `CMurmurSherpa` (`Sources/CMurmurSherpa`) does the
/// zero-init and per-family field selection in C, and hands back a plain
/// opaque handle plus a few functions, one constructor per model family.
/// Mirrors `WhisperCppEngine`'s shape closely (same synchronous-C-API-via-
/// `Task.detached` structure) so the five engines stay interchangeable at
/// the call site.
