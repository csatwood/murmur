/// A third "Precise" recognition engine, alongside `WhisperEngine` and
/// `WhisperCppEngine`: NVIDIA's Parakeet TDT model, run locally via FluidAudio
/// (CoreML on the Neural Engine). Independent benchmarking has shown it
/// transcribing noticeably faster than both Apple's built-in engine and the
/// Whisper-family engines here, with comparable accuracy.
///
/// Vocabulary biasing works differently here than in the Whisper-family
/// engines. Parakeet's transducer architecture has no decoder-prompt
/// mechanism equivalent to Whisper's, so `biasTerms` can't nudge the main
/// decode itself — instead this runs FluidAudio's separate CTC-based
/// vocabulary-boosting pass (`CustomVocabularyContext`; see
/// `Documentation/ASR/CustomVocabulary.md` in the FluidAudio checkout)
/// after the decode: a second, small CTC encoder listens to the same audio
/// for acoustic evidence of a bias term, and rescoring swaps in that term
/// only where the evidence clears FluidAudio's own confidence thresholds.
/// This is the mechanism prompt-based biasing could not be — testing this
/// against `DeveloperVocabulary`'s "Supabase" case showed a Whisper prompt
/// containing the term verbatim was still not enough on its own, because
/// prompt biasing only ever nudges token probabilities; it never checks a
/// candidate replacement against the actual audio the way CTC rescoring
/// does.
///
/// Boosted transcription runs on `UnifiedAsrManager` (FluidAudio's offline
/// batch manager), not `SlidingWindowAsrManager` (its live-transcript one)
/// — the latter was tried first and had a real, reproduced bug: its
/// confirm/promote logic, needed to stabilize a *streaming* view, could
/// inject spurious text at a chunk boundary on longer recordings once
/// Murmur zeroed its confirmation thresholds (required to make rescoring
/// apply to a short dictation at all). Filed upstream as
/// github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio/issues/912. `UnifiedAsrManager`'s
/// overlap-merge (`collapseSeamWordDuplicates`) doesn't have this failure
/// mode in testing, and needs no duration cap to avoid it — the real
/// trade is that its model (`parakeet-unified-en-0.6b`) is English-only,
/// so boosting is now gated on English dictation instead of on recording
/// length. `v2`/`v3` above still handle the plain (non-boosted) decode for
/// every other language exactly as before; this only changes what happens
/// when boosting is requested.
///
/// Falls back to the plain one-shot decode (no boosting) whenever the
/// caller doesn't request boosting (see `transcribe`'s `boostVocabulary`),
/// the dictation isn't English, the CTC model isn't downloaded/loaded yet,
/// there are no bias terms, or the boosted path fails for any reason —
/// boosting must never be the reason a dictation comes back empty.
///
/// Model files are cached in FluidAudio's own default location
/// (`~/Library/Application Support/FluidAudio/Models/`) rather than under
/// Murmur's own support directory like the other two engines — there's no
/// reason to fight a sensible library default just for consistency.
